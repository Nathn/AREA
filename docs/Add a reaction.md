# Adding a Reaction to the AREA Project

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to add a new reaction to a [service](./Add%20a%20service.md) in the AREA project. Follow these instructions to seamlessly integrate your new reaction into the existing ecosystem.

> This guide assumes that you already have a working project, a properly configured service and at least one working [action](./Add%20an%20action.md) to test your reaction with.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites ready before proceeding:

- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) or another MongoDB edition software installed with access to the AREA database,
- Two valid `.env` files in the [/server](/../server/.env) and [/web](/../web/.env) folder, based on the contents of both `.env.example` files,
- Docker services `area-server` and `area-client-web` running without errors (check [localhost:8081]([http://localhost:8081]) to be sure).

## Step 1: Server part

## Step 2: Deploying with the database
